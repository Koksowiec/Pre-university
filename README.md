# My old projects
Here is a combination of most of my old projects which I created during my school days.
It consists of some basic HTML,CSS,JavaScript,PHP websites; some Unity games; basic C# and python applications.
The only reason I keep this project now is a sentimental value and a quick way for me to check how much I have progressed over the years.

If you are curious, you can check it too.

# WELCOME TO MY old CV
Below was Krzysztof Szczepański's CV, WSB Wrocław student.
Most of the work has the english and polish description, the code is mostly written in english but may contain polish words.

Here you can find some of my works, like my older projects when I was trying out PHP or C++ or some newer projects, like games made in Unity in C#.
